# Frontend Mentor | Recipe Page Solution

## Overview

This project is a solution to the Recipe Page challenge provided by Frontend Mentor. It is a single-page layout that presents a simple omelette recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

## What I Learned

During the course of this project, I deepened my understanding of several key aspects of frontend development:

### Margin and Padding
I focused on learning when and how to use margin and padding effectively to control the spacing of elements on the page. This helped in creating a clean and visually appealing layout.

### Pseudo-Elements
I revisited some pseudo-elements, which I hadn't used much before. This project gave me an opportunity to understand their usefulness in styling specific parts of elements, like list markers, without additional HTML markup.

### Flexbox vs. Grid
I also reinforced my knowledge of when to use Flexbox and Grid for layout management. Flexbox proved particularly useful in aligning items within rows and managing space between content in this project, especially in the nutrition table and instructions list.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured the content semantically to ensure clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Styled the page using custom properties (CSS variables), Flexbox for layout alignment, and pseudo-elements for enhanced styling.

## Code Snippets

### HTML Structure
```html
<div class="all-content">
    <img class="egg" src="assets/images/image-omelette.jpeg" alt="egg image">
    <h1> Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
    <p>An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked
        to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.</p>
    <!-- Additional work of mine continues... -->
</div>

## Final Thoughts

This project not only helped me refine my existing frontend skills but also introduced me to new techniques that I can apply to future projects. It was an excellent exercise in balancing layout aesthetics with functional code.
